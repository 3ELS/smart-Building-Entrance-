# smart-Building-Entrance-
Governments and societies all over the world pay more and more attention to the research and development of smart buildings. There are numerous research projects on smart buildings that have been or being conducted worldwide. Buildings used to be fairly simple their own requirements were four walls, a roof, and maybe some flooring. As humans have developed more complicated technologies such as plumbing, electricity, telephone systems, networked computing, and wireless networking, the level of complexity required in building projects has increased exponentially. Modern buildings are almost like living organisms, with intricate systems for providing amenities and information. Advances in sensors and networking are creating new ways for buildings to meet and even anticipate the needs of their users while reducing costs and increasing efficiency. In this project report, we give an introduction about a newly launched research project. This project will explore “smart building” one of the technologies and Discuss it
